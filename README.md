# How to use the tool

# Quality in Last Oasis

I couldn't have made it better myself, so I prefer to redirect you to this online document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rM6Gt2k3zWGwzAbSeO1cdze2qWqe12p3dUpUdDz97z4/edit#

Props to the guys from OwO, who are responsible for creating this useful guide!

# Questions and Answers

Q: Isn't your program considered cheating?

A: No, unless you consider sharing Excel-Tables with your friends cheating aswell. LOQSTool's functionality is technically merely a more optimized shared spreadsheet.
#
Q: Is this software free?

A: Primarily and at the moment yes, but not all future features will be. Since my tool heavily depends on cloud based traffic, which I pay out of my own pocket at the moment, I will have to implement a way to compensate for the costs, sooner or later. I consider leaving this tool entirely for free for common use and put some small pricetags on special features, like individual contracts with big clans. However, this is merely a fun project to me so I have no interest of making profit. I consider myself a non-profit-organization.
#
Q: I really don't want to pay for this, do I have to eventually, in oder to use the software to its fullest extend?

A: This software lives off of YOUR contribution. My goal is to implement a way to reward data contributions with free access to all of the softwares features. In other words: You keep submitting your found quality nodes and contributing to the ecosystem of the tool and I will try to keep it as free as possible for you. More info on that in the future.
#
Q: Why doesn't the tool read out the resource data from the game automatically?

A: To ensure your safety, I do not implement any functionality, that interacts with the gameprocess itself, since that may lead to account suspension. As of so far, the game devs seem extremely strict when it comes to the use of external software. I am already prepared for that day, however, on which the devs might allow my software to read out gamedata automatically, either through an API or image-recognition. Once I see a green light from the devs, I will be implementing a feature to automatically add data immediately. Until then, my goal is to make the data input as smooth and comfortable as possible.
